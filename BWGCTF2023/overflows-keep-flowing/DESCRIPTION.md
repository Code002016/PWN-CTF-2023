# Overflows keep flowing

Oh no! Another thing in another system broke causing more overflows. This time you have to tell `shutoff()` what to shut off. Can you save the fl4gtory?

This is the second challenge in the pwn intro series

Some helpful tools and tips:
- We have provided source code for this challenge, but if you want you can of course also solve it without source code. If you want to do this have a look at [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/). Also have a look at our intro rev challenge `on-time-production`
- For debugging, gdb is very helpful and [pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) makes this experience much nicer
- For writing your exploits, [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) is a great library. We have provided an skeleton pwntools script. You just have to provide the exploit ;)
- (See `HELP.md` in the handout for `on-time-production` for a little more detailed explaination to ghidra and pwntools)
